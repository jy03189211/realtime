realtime
========

Uhmmm...Just assign for review...

The course is scheduled in the timetable of the class TI09S1E .  You should register to the course using WinhaWille.
The identification code of the course isTI00AA55 and the implementation code is 2002.

After completing the unit the student knows the principles and practice of implementing real time and embedded systems, especially what comes to the use of operating system services via the operating system calls and library functions. He/she can develop systems that consist of multiple communicating processes or threads. The features of the standard IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, -2004, -2008 (POSIX.1) is followed and a special emphasis is put to the real time extensions of the standard like timers, real time signals, asynchronous i/o, semaphores, shared memory objects and so on.

Main topics
